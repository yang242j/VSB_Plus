## The Basics

### WHO
    Who should I test with? 
    - Students currently studying at the University of Regina.
    - Students who are not familiar with the course selection system of the University of Regina.
    - Lecturers who may be authorized to manage the system as an administrator.

### WHAT
    What kind of user testing should we do?
    - Black box testing, which means that the user does not know what is happening inside the code or the system.
    - In order to simulate the real user environment, the user will not get any help from the developer.

### WHERE
    Where does this test happen?
    - Due to COVID-19, the test can only be done online via email or message.

### WHEN
    When does this test happen and how long will it take?
    - User testing is performed immediately after the completion of the first MVP.
    - Normally, the user test will not exceed 30 minutes.
    - For users who need more instructions or technical assistance, this test will not exceed 1 hour.

### HOW
    How to implement the testing?
    - The user will receive the IP address of the website, as well as the username and password used to log in.

## The Goal, Underlying Objectives, & Tactics
    The goal of the project is to optimize the student's course registration experience. The project is a web-based application. 
    The test plan is to ensure that it meets the needs of users and that all functions work as expected. In addition, the result/reply of the user test will be used as the upgrade target for the next MVP.

## Measuring Success in User Testing
All pages will be tested according to the following standards:
1. Absolutely no crush, request timeout or other major issues.
2. The main function of the page should be perfectly implemented.
3. The secondary functions of the page may have limitations, but it does not affect the performance of the page.
